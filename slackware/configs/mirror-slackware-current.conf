# Where do you want to create the local mirror? The Slackware directory tree
# will be stored as ${SLACKROOTDIR}/${SLACKRELEASE}
# This value can be overruled via the '-l' commandline parameter;
SLACKROOTDIR="$( cd "$( dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" )" && pwd )"

# What architecture will we be mirroring? The default is 'x86' meaning 32bit.
# Alternatively you can specify 'x86_64' meaning 64bit. The value of ARCH
# determines the name of the slackware directories.
# This value can be overruled via the '-a' commandline parameter;
ARCH="x86_64"

# The slackware release we're mirroring (defaults to 'current').
# You can use the script's '-r' switch to alter this to another release,
# for instance mirror Slackware 13.37 by passing '-r 13.37' to the script.
RELEASE="current"

# The RSYNC mirror:
# Supply a full rsync URI in the RSYNCURLROOT variable, while leaving out
# the final "slackware-current" directory. Do not remove the trailing slash!
# RSYNCURL will become ${RSYNCURLROOT}${SLACKRELEASE} further down.
# An alternative rsync mirror URI can also be passed to the script with
# the '-m' option - that URI must *not* have a trailing slash.
#RSYNCURLROOT="mirrors.slackware.com::slackware/"
RSYNCURLROOT="mirrors.unixsol.org::slackware/"


# If you need to feed rsync's "external" program additional options (such as
# an identity file for passwordless login over ssh if your remote server is
# no real rsync server), Use EXTOPTS for passing those additional options.
# Example: EXTOPTS="-oIdentityFile=/home/alien/.ssh/id_rsa -l alien"
# This is an option you can also set using the '-s' parameter on the command
# line, like so:
# -s '-oIdentityFile=/home/alien/.ssh/id_rsa -l alien'
# If this is defined, then "ssh" will be used as the "external" program.
EXTOPTS=""

# The defaults: somewhat moderate output in all cases;
# You can alter this behaviour by passing either the
# '-q' (totally silent unless there is an update) or the '-v' (be verbose)
# switch to the script.
DEBUG=1
#VERBOSE="-q"
VERBOSE="-v"

# Set ISO="DVD" if you want a single DVD instead of four CD ISO's.
# Set ISO="CDROM" if you want four CD ISO's instead of a single DVD.
# Set ISO="ALL" if you want four CD ISO's as well as a single DVD ISO.
# Set ISO="NONE" if you just want to sync the local mirror but don't need ISOs.
# Set ISO="MINI" if you want only the mini ISO (network installer).
#    Note: setting ISO="MINI" will result in a partial sync (no packages)!
# You can set the ISO variable using the '-o <iso_type>' switch too.
# ISO="DVD"
ISO="NONE"

# If you want to skip the rsync stage entirely, and just want to build
# ISO image(s) from your local tree, then set ISOONLY="yes"
# (or use '-i' parameter with the script)
ISOONLY="no"

# Normally, when no update is found in the ChangeLog.txt, the script exits
# without creating ISO images. If you want ISO images nonetheless, set
# the variable FORCE to "yes" (or pass the '-f' switch to the script).
FORCE="no"

# You might just want to check if the ChangeLog.txt changed...
# In that case, set ONLYDIFF to '1'. The script will exit after showing the
# diff between your local and the remote server's version.
# Corresponds to the '-n' option.
ONLYDIFF=0

# The default is not to remove the previous ISO until the new ISO has been
# created. Set PREREMOVE to '1' if you want the old ISO to be removed before
# running 'mkisofs' - this is useful in case you are short on disk space.
# Corresponds to the '-p' option.
PREREMOVE=1

# If you want a 'hybrid' ISO image which can be copied directly to a USB stick
# to create a bootable USB media, set HYBRID to '1'.
# Corresponds to the '-u' option.
HYBRID=1

# The value of EXCLUDES is what the script will exclude from the mirroring
# process; there is no parameter for the script to change this value, but you
# can use '-X excludefile' to define more excluded directories/files if you
# wish. Or directly edit the line below of course:
EXCLUDES="--exclude pasture"

# By default we do not use an 'excludes' file to rsync, but you can override
# that by using the '-X' parameter or set EXCLUDEFILE to a filename:
# By default the script does not mirror /pasture , use '-X none' (the 'none'
# is taken as a special value by the script) to also mirror /pasture .
EXCLUDEFILE="$( cd "$( dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" )" && pwd )/mirror-slackware-current.exclude"


# If you want to exclude more from the DVD ISO than just the ./testing
# directory, you can add the directories to DVD_EXCLUDES.
# The pathnames must be local to the top level and must start with ./
#DVD_EXCLUDES=${DVD_EXCLUDES:-"-x ./testing"}
DVD_EXCLUDES="-x ./testing  -x ./source -x ./extra/source"

# By default, this script will use all available bandwidth (BWLIMIT=0).
# If you want to limit bandwith usage to NN KBytes/sec, set BWLIMIT=NN
# or use the '-b NN' parameter.
BWLIMIT=0

# The script can check if a newer version of itself is available for download.
# If you want this, set CHECKVER="yes" or use the '-c' parameter to the script.
CHECKVER="no"

# By default, this script uses a 'boot-load-size' of 4 (KB) as argument
# to the 'mkisofs' command.
# Slackware's bootable DVD and CDROM use a value of 32, and although that
# value follows the standard better, it will create an ISO that will not boot
# on many older 'broken' PC BIOSes.
# The script will use the value of "32" if you pass the parameter '-e'
# or change the value below:
BOOTLOADSIZE=4
